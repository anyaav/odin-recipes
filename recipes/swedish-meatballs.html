    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Swedish Meatballs Method</em></strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes or until tender but still translucent.</li>
        <li>Reserve the onions. </li>
        <li>Combine the milk, egg, breadcrumbs, and spices in a large bowl. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes to allow the breadcrumbs to absorb the milk.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and pork, and reserved onions to the breadcrumb mixture. Combine the mixture by hand for about 1 minute or until the meat mixture is completely homogenous.</li>
        <li>Roll the mixture into 1 ½-inch meatballs. Cover and refrigerate the meatballs for 15-20 minutes to help keep their shape.</li>
        <li>In the same cast-iron skillet, melt the remaining butter over medium heat. Once bubbling, add the meatballs and brown them on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Make sure to flip the meatballs frequently to preserve their round shape. </li>
        <li>Once completely browned, check the temperature of the meatball, if below 165 °F, continue cooking until the meatballs are cooked through. </li>
        <li>Reserve the cooked meatballs. Keep the cast-iron pan and residual butter for the sauce./li>
    </ol>
   <p><strong><em>Cream Sauce Method</em></strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the same cast-iron pan used for cooking the meatballs, reheat the residual butter (if necessary).</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour and cook until the mixture turns dark blonde or beige.</li>
        <li>Slowly stream in the stock into the roux. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once all of the stock is incorporated, add the cream and soy sauce (if using). Cook the sauce over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season the sauce to taste with salt, peppers, and optionally, allspice. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><em>Cranberry Sauce Method</em></strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the berries, sugar, and water in a medium saucepan. </li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then continue cooking for 15-20 minutes, until the sauce thickens. </li>
        <li>Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
